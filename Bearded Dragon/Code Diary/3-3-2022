Looking up and learning stuff about the java application project.

I believe it would be best to code our project with Maven because
  1. it is a more powerful toolset with which to build a project in Java
  2. it seems to be the industry standard build tool
  3. if the app will be further developed then it would probably be best to use this toolkit
  4. it automatically creates the right project structure
  
  
Upon creation of a java with Maven project, you will see the following project structure:
ProjectName
  ->source packages
    >com.mycompany.projectname
  ->Dependencies
  ->Java Dependencies
    >JDK 14(Default)
      >(a whole bunch of stuff)
  ->Project File
    >pom.xml
    
    But what do these mean exactly?
    Source Packages - these contain anything with a .java extension including java classes, interfaces, and enumeration type files.
    The rest seems to be irrelevant for now.
    
    When you create a class file, make sure it is placed within source packages
    
    For information about Maven standard directory layout: https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html
    >But the important information is that images that will be used within the UI will need to be located in src/main/resources folder since Maven looks for it there by default.
    >src/main/java has all the class files
    
    <<<<Now onto the really important stuff--UI templates>>>>
    To create a UI template, create a package to house it and then add JFrame/JPanel form.  This tool lets you design the window without coding and then running the program repeatedly.
    You can drag/drop design features such as buttons, choose colors, and more.  To open the code behind a feature, double click it.
    
    But how do you create/design multiple UI windows?  Still learning but it seems like your just creat another form and make sure the code references all the windows.
