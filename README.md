# SE370-2022-Team4-HowToFeedYourDragon
SE370 Project developed by Benno Wiedner, Lily Bailey, Elaeth Lilagan. 

**PURPOSE:**

● Bearded dragons are a class of pet that fall under the category of exotic species. Unlike
dogs or cats, the care requirements for these pets tends to suffer from poor
documentation, misinformation, information disputes, and an overall lack of knowledge.
Perhaps the biggest challenge for a bearded dragon owner is diet since bearded dragons
are omnivores and many different types of food must be incorporated into their diet. It
can be daunting for a bearded dragon owner to comb through the list of approved foods
and put together an adequate diet based on veterinary guidelines. This is the target
market for this application.

● There is no existing meal plan software for bearded dragons. The tools to easily fill this
niche are effectively non-existent. Planning a sufficiently balanced diet to maintain
proper health can be difficult even for the most experienced owner. This tool can help
every owner regardless of experience improve the nutritional wellbeing of their pet.

**ABOUT:** 

***System name: How to feed your dragon***

Providing owners of bearded dragons with a flexible and powerful tool to help maintain
proper nutrition throughout the full lifecycle. The dietary needs of these pets changes
with age and other unique factors for each pet. By empowering the owners of these pets,
this application will help maintain healthier pets, and more positive ownership
experiences for our users.

This is a local application that maintains a list of safe foods for bearded dragons. In
addition to having a complete listing of approved foods for the pet, the application will
provide a breakdown of the best available dietary information for the pet based on its age.
This will include tracking of various dietary restrictions on a timeline suitable for these
pets.

**User characteristics:**

The primary use group for this software is inclusive of pet owners of bearded dragons. This is designed to be useful to both novices and expert owners in tracking the     requirements to maintain positive dietary health for this breed of exotic pet.

   ***● Key user groups***

   *Novice:* First time pet owners of a bearded dragon, possess little to no prior knowledge of how to care for a bearded dragon. Provide a general overview as well as a deeper    insight to what may benefit the bearded dragon.
   
   *Hobbyist:* Possesses moderate knowledge of owning a bearded dragon and providing the diet required for its care. The app will focus on providing any tips to help the bearded dragon, which will benefit their health and companionship with the owner. 
   
   *Master:* Professional experts and/or long time enthusiasts that are interested in recording data of the reptiles diet and potentially maintaining better records.

   ***● Additional user considerations***

   Sometimes children and the elderly are bearded dragon owners so care must be taken that the interface is friendly to those inexperienced with technology and simple to understand for younger audiences.
